# KSP website

This is a static website generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Most pages are written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Updating the carousel

Update the [carousel data file](https://github.com/kspublications/kspublications.github.io/blob/master/_data/carousels.yml) to modify the list of carousel elements. Each element starts with a hypen as shown in the example below.

```yaml
- caption: Our Catalog
  href: /catalog
  image: https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/61224/3488211/e7a20314-04d3-11e4-839e-68fea43f0db6.jpg
```

## Uploading images

Currently the Github web interface does not allow you to directly upload images, so you'll need to use the Github client for Mac or Windows. However, you can also use the following workaround for now:

1. Click [here](https://github.com/kspublications/kspublications.github.io/issues/1) and drag your image to the `Leave a comment box`.
2. Copy the markdown that was generated, you'll paste that wherever you want to put the image later. If you only want the URL (for the carousel for example) just copy everything inside of the parenthesis.
3. Click the `Comment` button to save the comment.
