This book is the first in the series. It deals with sickness, which continues to
afflict human beings from birth until death. Sickness strikes as light as a
simple cold or allergy, and as hard as a plague or cancer. It keeps the human
being under check, reminding him of his weakness and giving him a chance to turn
to the One who possesses to afflict and cure. This book deals with sickness,
its regulations, and lessons associated with it. It presents the Islamic stand
toward a number of modern medical issues, and also discusses important regulations
relating to those with disabilities.
